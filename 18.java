//Question: Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a 
//function to compute the researcher's h-index.According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of 
//his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

//========================Code=============

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        
        Arrays.sort(citations);
 
    int result = 0;
    for(int i=citations.length-1; i>=0; i--){
        int cnt = citations.length-i;
        if(citations[i]>=cnt){
            result = cnt;
        }else{
            break;
        }
    }
 
    return result;
    }
}
